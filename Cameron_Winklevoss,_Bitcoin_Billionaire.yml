    All of them can hold bitcoin. None of them can hold gold. 
    Bitcoin is the future. Number go up! To the moon!

    > To be precise, none of the smart phones hold any bitcoin. Bitcoin is on the blockchain.

    Bitcoin will overtake gold. I can't say when, 
    but I can say within the next decade. 

    Bitcoin grew 60x in the past five years. 
    To overtake gold it will need to grow 25x in the next ten years - 
    in other words, grow half as much in twice as much time.

    Number go up! To the moon!
