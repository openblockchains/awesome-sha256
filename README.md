## Best of Crypto Quotes

### David Gerard, Blockchain Journalist


If Bitcoin is like an Excel spreadsheet,
then Ethereum is like a spreadsheet with macros.

  §

Dogecoin started originally as a joke based on the "Doge" Shiba Inu Internet meme.
The idea was mostly to have some fun with cryptocurrency cheap enough to mess around with;
and who knows, maybe we'll all get rich!

  §

Tether is "too big to fail" - the entire crypto industry utterly
depends on it. We just topped twenty billion alleged dollars' worth of tethers ($USDT).
If you think this is sustainable, you're a fool.

### Amy Castor, Blockchain Journalist


We have not entered "Post Tether" yet.
Tether is still furiously printing digital ($USDT) bucks.
Who believes Bitcoin's price is organic?
It's not - it's a Ponzi, and Tether is its Little Helper.

> Austrian Maximalist comments:
>
> Bitcoin is not a ponzi. It is a monetary network, first of its kind.
> Currently valued at 365 billion dollars. What am I missing?

  §

If you can print billions and billions in fake money,
you can make the price of Bitcoin whatever you want - until too many people
try and cash out, that is.

### Nouriel_Roubini, Economist

Investing in Bitcoin is equivalent to take your portfolio
to a rigged illegal casino and gamble; at least in legit Las Vegas casinos odds
aren't stacked against you as those gambling markets aren't manipulated
the way Bitcoin is. Instead Bitcoin is manipulated heavily by Tether and whales.

  §

2% of accounts control 95% of bitcoin assets.
Inequality Gini coefficient of Bitcoin is worse than the one
of North Korea where Mr Kim and his cronies controls most of the country assets!

  §

No use ever, past, present and future for XRP and Ripple products...
it is already flopping after spending a fortune and printing a huge amount
of totally useless XRP. (Now the XRP army of Twitter trolls,
bots, hired guns and zealots will attack again...)

  §

From Bitfinex'ed:
«Stablecoins "backed" by USD are technically already illegal.
  Because if they were to gain traction, people would be able to have numbered,
  and anonymous, bank accounts.

You've reinvented numbered bank accounts.»

### SEC Investor Education

A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors.
Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi. In the 1920s, Ponzi promised investors a 50% return 
within a few months for what he claimed was an investment in international mail coupons.

  §

Ponzi schemes require a constant flow of new money to survive. 
When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, 
or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, 
these schemes collapse.

  §

Ponzi scheme "red flags" - High returns with little or no risk:
Every investment carries some degree of risk, 
and investments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. 
Be highly suspicious of any "guaranteed" [number-go-up to-the-moon] "investment" opportunity.

  §
  
Ponzi scheme "red flags" - Avoid too-good-to-be-true "investments" with claims like:
- "To the moon! To the mars!" 
- "Number go up!"
- "Yearly return of 300+% in 2020!"
- "Could quadruple in 2021 and rally to $100,000!"

### Trolly McTrollface, Bitcoin Greater Fool Court Jester

Congrats on writing about Bitcoin's price without mentioning Tether ($USDT).
It's like writing about bond yields without mentioning inflation and the Fed.

  §

People will believe anything, as long as it gives them an easy answer
to the most important question in the universe: "How can I become rich quickly and without working?"

"International reply coupon exchange" sounded just as cool and mysterious as "censorship-resistant money".

Fitchburg Daily Sentinel News Headline (July 11, 1920):
PONZI WILL NOT REVEAL BUSINESS SECRET

  §

The crypto cartel's smartest propaganda move was to create the HODLer culture.
By glorifying the act of doing nothing, they reached out to the self-entitled, lazy millionaire wannabes.
Every Ponzi scheme relies on the hope that investors won't sell.
This one's just too obvious.

  §

One argument against Bitcoin being a Ponzi scheme, is that there's no intent to deceive.
Really? You have thousands of Bitcoin "personalities" spewing out crap daily.

> I believe gold is sunsetting, whereas bitcoin is just starting.
>
> I believe the current (or what I call the legacy) system is broken. 
> And bitcoin fixes this. 
> 
> -- Changpeng Zhao ("CZ Binance"), Bitcoin Billionaire, Binance Exchange Founder

  §
  
The only way to pay out old Bitcoin investors is to get money from new investors. 
The only difference with a genuine Ponzi scheme, is who pays the old investors. 
It's not the "fraudsters", but exchanges. Neat!
  
  §

Forget the meme that "Bitcoin transactions are cheap". 
The true cost of a transaction isn't the "transaction fees" - those are indeed manageable, 
a few dollars per transaction - but the cost of maintaining the network. 
As the Bitcoin network currently processes around 300,000 transactions per day at a cost of $28M 
(plus transaction fees), the true cost of one transaction is around $100.

  §

For the next three and a half years, block rewards will be worth 6.25 Bitcoins, 
or around 200,000 USD at current prices. 

Remember – there's one block reward every ten minutes, so that's $28M per day. 
That's a lot of money, and a huge incentive for miners to buy new ASICs and run them, burning electricity.
[...]
In a perfect market equilibrium, the cost of mining Bitcoin is equal to the rewards. 
It's never the exactly the case, but it's a good rule of thumb for evaluating how much it costs to run the network.

Bitcoin electronic waste generation is at 10.324 kilotonnes per year 
(comparable to a country like Luxembourg) - see bitcoinelectronicwaste.com 

A footprint of 91.2 grams per unique transaction 
(equal to the weight of 1.4 'C'-size batteries or 2 golf balls). 

  §

The latest Bitcoin energy consumption index is 77.782 TWh per year 
(comparable to a country like Chile) - see bitcoinenergyconsumption.com

The energy footprint per unique transaction is 690.8 kWh (enough to power 1 U.S. household for 23.7 days) 

> Austrian Maximalists comments:
>  Bitcoin will drive a renewable energy revolution.

  §

Bitcoin's TWh usage results in a carbon footprint of 36.95 MtCO₂ 
(comparable to a country like New Zealand) - see bitcoinenergyconsumption.com

The carbon footprint per unique transaction is 327.50 kgCO₂ (equivalent to 725,861 VISA transactions) 

  §

Note that the share of fossil fuel based energy has been on the rise this year 
due to the growing popularity of countries like Kazakhstan. 
This is only expected to rise further: Reuters News -

### Jemima Kelly, Financial Times Alphaville Journalist

The idea that you can get out of your bitcoin position at any time and the market 
will stay intact is frankly a nonsense. And that's why the bitcoin religion's "HODL" mantra 
is so important to be upheld, of course.

Because if people start to sell, bad things might happen!

  §

It is estimated that about 20 per cent of bitcoins have been lost in various ways, 
never to be recovered. Then there are the so-called "whales" that hold most of the bitcoin, 
whose dominance of the market has risen in recent months. The top 2.8 per cent of bitcoin addresses 
now control 95 per cent of the supply (including many that haven't moved any bitcoin for the past half-decade), 
and more than 63 per cent of the bitcoin supply hasn't been moved for the past year, according to recent estimates.

What all this means is that real liquidity - the actual available supply of bitcoin - is very low indeed.

  §

What we call the "bitcoin price" is in fact only the price of the very small number of bitcoins 
that wash around the retail market, and doesn't represent the price that 18.6m bitcoins 
would actually be worth, even if they were all actually available.

So the "market cap" is in this way nonsense multiplied. You times two things together 
that don't reflect what they claim to - the "circulating supply" and the "price" - and voilà!

### Patrick McKenzie, Recovering Japanese Salaryman 

A friend of mine, who works in finance, asked me to explain what Tether was.

Short version: Tether is the internal accounting system for
the largest fraud since Madoff's ponzi scheme.

  §

Many Bitcoin exchanges use "I am a James Bond villain" as a compliance strategy;
they are present everywhere and nowhere geographically,
always where they need to be to move the plot along
but never where they are meaningfully constrained.

Much like Bond villains, though,
most Bitcoin exchanges will not survive the third act.

Imagine not buying Bitcoin at $22 - $30 because you think you missed the bus at $10 ... 
I am here to tell you it's the same now with $22 000 - $30 000. 
Buying at $10 000 versus $22 000 won't matter in the long run.

Bitcoin Classic (BTC) is ridiculous; in what world is paying $15 to move a mere $90 ok? 
This is literally worst than PayPal, Western Union and my bank COMBINED

### Preston Byrne, Blockchain Attorney

The Bitcoin "Nakamoto Scheme" is an automated hybrid of a Ponzi and pyramid scheme 
which has, from the perspective of operating a criminal enterprise, 
the strengths of both and the weaknesses of neither.

The Nakamoto Scheme draws strength from what make pyramids and Ponzis 
so compelling:
a) it promises insane investment returns, 
b) can be accessed by the man on the street with almost no effort at all, and  
c) recruits individual participants as new, self-interested evangelists of the scheme.

  §

> Bitcoin's market cap just passed Visa's.
> Yes, that Visa:
> - Largest electronic payment processor in the world
> - $8.9 trillion in 141 billion transactions per year
> - Across 160 currencies and over 200 countries
   
For contrast, Bitcoin gets about 3 transactions per second, 
with one "currency," and the network is currently clogged.

  §

> As the value of Bitcoin goes up, the energy used to mine the cryptocurrency 
> has reached a staggering 30.59 terawatt-hours (TWh)
>
> That's on par with the energy use of the entire country of Morocco.

Considering the alternative (using old school finance and landing in jail), 
I can see how some Bitcoiners might see this as a price worth paying 
in order to access the billions of dollars currently sloshing around in the Bitcoin markets.

### Jorge Stolfi, Computer Scientist

If a transaction has two inputs of 3 BTC and 1 BTC, 
and two outputs of 2 BTC and 2 BTC, you cannot tell which output came from which input.

That is the basic principle of ~~money laundering~~ coin mixing services.

  §

Bitcoin is a Ponzi.
Investing in bitcoin, like "investing" in lottery tickets, is a very negative-sum game. 
Namely, at any time, the total amount that all investors have taken out is considerably 
less than what they have put into the scheme; the difference being the amount that the operators have taken out. 
Thus the investors, as a whole, are always in the red, and their collective loss only increases with time.

  §

Bitcoin is a Ponzi.
As a minimum, the operators should warn investors of the negative-sum character and negative expected profit. 
In the case of bitcoin (and all other cryptos), not only that does not happen, 
but there are thousands of promoters and "investment experts" who predict impressive price increases 
and/or claim that bitcoin will have massive uses in the future that would somehow make it valuable. 
Apart from the mendacity of those claims, those promoters never point out that such massive uses 
would not translate into revenue for the investors.

  §

Bitcoin is a Ponzi. 
Objection! The operator must lie to investors about the source of profit in a Ponzi!

Crypto promoters from Andreessen to Zhao actively spread many lies and misleading claims 
about the scheme, through malice or ignorance. Investment "experts" like Tom Lee, Mike Novogratz
and Dan Morehead often give extremely optimistic predictions 
for the price on business or mainstream media. Those predictions have no rational basis whatsoever, 
and, while qualified with "perhapses" an "maybes" and "not investment advice" disclaimers, 
they are obviously intended to promote investment in the coins.

  §
  
Bitcoin is a Ponzi. 
Objection! The operator must lie to investors about the source of profit in a Ponzi!

Crypto promoters also make dozens of claims about the virtues of the currency and/or the payment system, 
such as that it will "one day" replace credit cards, replace national currencies, 
protect people's savings from inflation or confiscation by government, make banks obsolete, 
starve governments to death by depriving them of taxes or "money printing", 
enable support of dissidents in oppressive regimes, "bank the unbanked", 
allow free internet trade of drugs and other illegal items, 
end corruption, poverty, and inequality, etc. etc. etc.
  
  §  

Bitcoin is a Ponzi. 
Objection! By that definition the U.S. Dollar (USD$) is a Ponzi! 

No, national currencies fail to fit the definition, because people do not "invest" 
in them with the expectation of gain. In fact, governments make their currencies 
slightly inflationary precisely to discourage hoarding.
