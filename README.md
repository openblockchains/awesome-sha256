>
> Bitcoin is not a ponzi. It is a monetary network, first of its kind.
> Currently valued at 365 billion dollars. What am I missing?

It's like writing about bond yields without mentioning inflation and the Fed.

  §

People will believe anything, as long as it gives them an easy answer
to the most important question in the universe: "How can I become rich quickly and without working?"

"International reply coupon exchange" sounded just as cool and mysterious as "censorship-resistant money".

PONZI WILL NOT REVEAL BUSINESS SECRET

  §

The crypto cartel's smartest propaganda move was to create the HODLer culture.
By glorifying the act of doing nothing, they reached out to the self-entitled, lazy millionaire wannabes.
Every Ponzi scheme relies on the hope that investors won't sell.
This one's just too obvious.

Investing in Bitcoin is equivalent to take your portfolio

2% of accounts control 95% of bitcoin assets.
Inequality Gini coefficient of Bitcoin is worse than the one

From Bitfinex'ed:

Short version: Tether is the internal accounting system for
the largest fraud since Madoff's ponzi scheme.

  §

Many Bitcoin exchanges use "I am a James Bond villain" as a compliance strategy;
they are present everywhere and nowhere geographically,
always where they need to be to move the plot along
but never where they are meaningfully constrained.

Much like Bond villains, though,
most Bitcoin exchanges will not survive the third act.

Imagine not buying Bitcoin at $22 - $30 because you think you missed the bus at $10 ... 
I am here to tell you it's the same now with $22 000 - $30 000. 
Buying at $10 000 versus $22 000 won't matter in the long run.

> Austrian Maximalist comments:
>
>  I cured my fear of missing out (FOMO) at $9 000, $11 000 and $20 000, 
>  by buying without waiting for the dip.

  §

Bitcoin Classic (BTC) is ridiculous; in what world is paying $15 to move a mere $90 ok?
